# Clustering-Text-Documents-using-K-means-Algorithm

K-means is a method of vector quantization, that is popular for cluster analysis in data mining. Here, K is the number of clusters you want to create. K-means clustering aims to partition n documents into k clusters in which each document belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster. Each cluster has a cluster center called centroid.

1. k initial "means" (in this case k=3) are randomly generated within the data domain (shown in color).

2. k clusters are created by associating every observation with the nearest mean. The partitions here represent the Voronoi diagram generated by the means.

3. The centroid of each of the k clusters becomes the new mean.

4. Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until convergence has been reached.

## Steps to follow

- Accept .pdf and .txt documents from the given directory.
- Tokenize each document.
- Collect total individual words from all documents which are going to be components of document vector.
- Generate TF-IDF weights of each components for every document.
- Pass the list of documents in their vector representation along with k to k-means algorithm.
- Perform k-means.
- Print the Output.

## Stoping criteria

- A fixed number of iterations N has been completed.
- Assignment of documents to clusters does not change.
- Centroids do not change.
- Terminate when a required convergence is met.
